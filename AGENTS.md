# AGENTS.md - az-vm Engineering Contract

## Purpose
This repository manages Azure VM provisioning and lifecycle operations for Windows and Linux through one entrypoint. The project optimizes for parity, deterministic behavior, strong validation before mutation, and operator-visible outcomes.

## Source of Truth Hierarchy
Use these sources in this order when maintaining the repo:
1. Current code and task-folder manifests for runtime behavior.
2. Current CLI/help output for command-surface truth.
3. Current `.env.example` for committed configuration contract.
4. Current local `.env` only when a user explicitly states that their local runtime configuration is the temporary source of truth for alignment work.
5. Git history for project evolution.
6. Relevant `.codex` session JSONL files for workflow, decision, and prompt-history reconstruction.

## Repository Context Assimilation Rule
- For every user prompt implementation, scan the current repo context before coding:
  - codebase structure (`modules/`, task directories, tools, tests)
  - active documentation contract (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `release-notes.md`, `docs/prompt-history.md`)
  - test and quality entrypoints
- Treat this scan as mandatory pre-work, not optional discovery.
- Implement changes so they align with:
  - existing architecture and naming conventions
  - current command and configuration contracts
  - established workflow and validation patterns
- Do not introduce behavior that conflicts with repository standards when a compatible approach already exists in the codebase.
- At the start of a new coding session, the assistant must re-assimilate repository context (code, docs, tests, recent history) before making edits.
- Prefer extending existing patterns over creating parallel patterns.
- Respect repository continuity: keep behavior and terminology coherent with prior development unless the user explicitly requests a contract-breaking change.

## Repository Map
- `az-vm.cmd`: elevated launcher for Windows operators.
- `az-vm.ps1`: unified orchestrator entrypoint.
- `modules/`: runtime modules grouped by domain.
- `windows/init/`, `windows/update/`: Windows stage roots with portable task folders at the root, portable disabled task folders under `disabled/`, and portable local-only task folders under `local/` and `local/disabled/`.
- `linux/init/`, `linux/update/`: Linux stage roots with portable task folders at the root, portable disabled task folders under `disabled/`, and portable local-only task folders under `local/` and `local/disabled/`.
- `tools/`: helper tooling, pyssh bootstrap, git-hook toggles, and support scripts.
- `tests/`: static, compatibility, audit, and contract checks.
- `docs/prompt-history.md`: human-readable prompt ledger for this repo.

## Architecture Invariants
- Keep one orchestrator entrypoint: `az-vm.ps1`.
- Keep Linux and Windows flow and wording as identical as possible.
- Allow differences only where platform requirements genuinely differ:
  - image selection and guest OS behavior
  - init/update task language
  - Windows-only RDP and Windows service configuration
- Prefer explicit orchestration steps over hidden side effects.
- Prefer portable task folders plus `task.json` manifests over hard-coded ad hoc execution order.
- Keep command behavior deterministic across interactive and auto flows.

## Command-Surface Rules
- Current public commands are: `configure`, `create`, `update`, `list`, `show`, `do`, `task`, `connect`, `move`, `resize`, `set`, `exec`, `delete`, `help`.
- Do not preserve removed commands or aliases once the repo has cut over to a new surface.
- If a command or option is renamed, remove the old form cleanly and update all docs/tests in the same change.
- When a public option is renamed, rename the owning parameter files, manifest entries, parser lookups, help text, README examples, and smoke coverage in the same change; do not leave retired parameter-module filenames behind.
- Use `step` for top-level orchestration phases and `task` for guest task execution.
- Keep help output, README examples, and runtime messages aligned with the actual parser contract.
- Canonical target selectors are `--group` / `-g`, `--vm-name` / `-v`, and `--subscription-id` / `-s`.
- Value-taking options must accept both `--option=value` and `--option value`, plus short-form `-x=value` and `-x value` when a short alias exists.
- `task` owns task inventory, isolated `vm-init` / `vm-update` task runs, and task-scoped app-state save/restore.
- `task --save-app-state` defaults to `--source=vm`; `task --restore-app-state` defaults to `--target=vm`; both default to `--user=.all.`.
- `task --save-app-state` / `--restore-app-state` accept `--user=.all.`, `--user=.current.`, one explicit user, or a comma-separated user list.
- Local-machine task app-state save/restore is Windows-host-only, must validate the current `task.json` allow-list before local restore, and must write a lightweight backup plus restore journal before mutating the operator machine.
- `exec` is SSH-only: it may open an interactive shell or run one remote command through `--command` / `-c`, but it must not own isolated task execution.
- `connect` owns interactive/test connection flows and requires exactly one transport flag: `--ssh` or `--rdp`.
- `create` is fresh-only: it creates one new managed resource group plus one new managed VM target and must not be documented or wired as an existing-resource reuse path.
- `update` is existing-managed-target only: it requires one existing managed resource group plus one existing VM and must not fall through to implicit fresh-create behavior.
- `configure` is the managed target-selection and `.env` synchronization command: it must stay Azure-read-only, select only az-vm-managed targets, and persist only target-derived values from actual Azure state.
- Azure-touching commands support `--subscription-id` plus `-s`; resolution precedence is CLI override -> `.env` `SELECTED_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` -> active Azure CLI subscription.
- Azure-touching commands require an authenticated Azure CLI session; help, README, and runtime errors must say `az login` is required.
- Interactive `create` and `update` must prompt for Azure subscription selection when `--subscription-id` is omitted.
- `list` is the managed inventory command: it must stay Azure-read-only, must not mutate Azure resources, and must expose managed resource listings through `--type` plus optional exact `--group` filtering.
- Auto-mode strictness is part of the public contract: `create --auto` must resolve platform, VM name, Azure region, and platform VM size from CLI or `SELECTED_*` plus platform defaults in `.env`; `update --auto` must resolve one managed target from CLI or the selected target values in `.env`.
- `resize --disk-size` requires exactly one intent flag, `--expand` or `--shrink`; shrink remains a non-mutating guidance path when Azure cannot perform the requested change safely.

## Configuration Rules
- Runtime precedence is: CLI override > `.env` value > hard-coded default.
- `.env` is local-only and must remain untracked.
- `.env.example` is the committed configuration contract and must stay current.
- Keep app-wide customization, secrets, operator identity, and reusable overrides in `.env`.
- Keep task-only customization in a clearly labeled config block at the top of the owning `vm-init` or `vm-update` script.
- Do not hard-code personal, company-specific, or secret fallback values in runtime code or shared orchestration paths.
- Use generic env keys whenever possible.
- Treat `SELECTED_*` keys as the only persisted active-selection contract in `.env`.
- Use `SELECTED_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` as the shared default Azure subscription selector for Azure-touching commands.
- Use `SELECTED_COMPANY_NAME` for repo-managed Windows business web shortcuts and `SELECTED_EMPLOYEE_EMAIL_ADDRESS` local-part for repo-managed Windows personal web shortcuts.
- Normalize repo-managed Windows Chrome `--profile-directory` values to lowercase even when `.env` casing differs.
- Keep `SELECTED_EMPLOYEE_FULL_NAME` in `.env` as required operator identity metadata for the Windows public desktop shortcut contract.
- Use shared keys such as `VM_ENABLE_HIBERNATION` and `VM_ENABLE_NESTED_VIRTUALIZATION` for cross-platform VM feature intent instead of inventing platform-specific duplicates.
- Use `WIN_` or `LIN_` keys only for true platform-specific settings.
- Remove deprecated env keys instead of keeping compatibility fallbacks.
- Validate region, VM naming, SKU, image, and other mutation-critical config before Azure create/update/delete operations.

## Naming and Resource Rules
- `SELECTED_VM_NAME` is the persisted naming seed.
- Template-driven resource names must derive from the effective `SELECTED_VM_NAME` runtime value, region code, and the committed templates.
- Resource-group uniqueness is suffix-based and deterministic.
- Managed resource name generation must remain explicit, predictable, and validation-backed.
- Managed resource group ids use a globally increasing `gX` suffix across all managed groups, regardless of region.
- Managed resource ids use a globally increasing `nX` suffix across all generated managed resources; one generated `nX` must not be reused by another managed resource, even across resource types.
- If naming rules change, update README, tests, and any naming-related summaries in the same change.

## Task Folder Rules
- Each task lives in a portable folder named `<task-number>-verb-noun-target`.
- Each task folder must contain one same-named task script plus one `task.json`.
- Task-number bands are:
  - `01-99` for `initial`
  - `101-999` for `normal`
  - `1001-9999` for intentionally local-only tasks
  - `10001-10099` for `final`
- `task.json` is the execution-order, enable-state, timeout, asset, and app-state source of truth for tracked and local-only task folders.
- Intentionally local-only tasks live under `local/` as portable task folders and are discovered from disk at runtime.
- Intentionally local-only disabled tasks live under `local/disabled/` and remain disabled by location.
- Root `disabled/` remains for tracked disabled tasks.
- A missing task folder must be treated as absent; init/update execution must continue cleanly as if that task never existed.
- Malformed task folders must warn and skip instead of aborting the stage, unless duplicate names or duplicate effective priorities make execution order ambiguous.
- The only allowed task app-state source is the task-local plugin zip `<task-folder>/app-state/app-state.zip`.
- Builtin and local-only init/update task folders must use the same post-process app-state contract and the same exact task-local plugin path rule.
- Task-local `app-state/` folders are untracked and git-ignored; missing task plugins must log a skip and continue instead of failing the stage.
- Stage-root shared `app-states/`, task-side helper folders outside the owning task folder, and any legacy overlay paths must not be used as alternate app-state storage locations.
- Managed app-state save and restore must target only the `manager` and `assistant` OS profiles. Do not capture or replay `default` or arbitrary local user profiles.
- App-state capture is settings-first. Exclude generated installers, models, telemetry trees, caches, and other low-value runtime artifacts unless a task explicitly proves they are durable required state.
- `task.json` may supply `priority`, `enabled`, `timeout`, `assets`, and `appState`.
- Task priority precedence is: `task.json priority` -> filename task number -> deterministic fallback within the current task-number band.
- Runtime code must not auto-write, auto-sync, or auto-reconcile `task.json` files.
- For task folders with missing `priority`, default to the filename task number when available, otherwise `1000`.
- For task folders with missing `timeout`, default to `180`.
- Disabled tasks belong under `disabled/` and must be ignored by execution logic.
- Init and update task inventories may diverge by platform, but the orchestration model should remain parallel in concept.

## Reliability and Error-Handling Rules
- Validate before mutating Azure resources.
- Prefer fast, filtered Azure checks over broad slow listings.
- If Azure does not support a requested operation safely, fail before mutation with the explicit platform reason and list the supported alternatives.
- When lifecycle or connection flows find a VM stuck in provisioning state `Updating`, use one explicit bounded `az vm redeploy` repair attempt before failing the operation.
- Fail gracefully with:
  - a short reason
  - a precise corrective hint
  - no ambiguous extra noise
- Avoid retry storms. Retry policies must stay explicit and intentionally bounded.
- Prefer isolated diagnosis and targeted reruns over destructive full rebuild loops unless the user explicitly wants a rebuild.

## Logging and UX Rules
- Keep user-facing strings, comments, help text, and UI wording in English.
- Keep maintained repository documentation in English.
- The only allowed language exception is for literal user-defined display labels or product/site names that are intentionally preserved as-is, such as specific desktop shortcut titles.
- Keep Linux and Windows wording aligned for equivalent behavior.
- Keep logs contextual, singular, and readable.
- Do not emit duplicate informational lines without a real state change.
- Show durations for long-running operations when the feature exists, but avoid noisy transcript spam.
- When a stage produces warnings, failures, or reboot requests, summarize them clearly at stage end.
- Interactive `create` and `update` are review-first flows: only `group`, `vm-deploy`, `vm-init`, and `vm-update` may ask `yes/no/cancel` review questions.
- `configure` and `vm-summary` must always render without confirmation, even when partial step selection skips interior mutation stages.

## Windows Package and Path Rules
- Bootstrap Chocolatey unattended when missing.
- Enable `allowGlobalConfirmation` exactly once immediately after Chocolatey bootstrap.
- Call `refreshenv.cmd` after Chocolatey bootstrap and after each package installation verification step that depends on updated PATH resolution.
- Keep package-install behavior explicit. Do not add silent fallback installers unless the user explicitly requests them.
- Repo-managed Windows shortcuts must resolve to a real executable path, a validated embedded command path, or a valid `shell:AppsFolder\\<AUMID>` launch target; otherwise the shortcut must be skipped with a warning and stale managed aliases cleaned up.
- When a Windows task writes startup shortcuts or startup registry entries, it must verify the written artifact immediately instead of assuming startup registration succeeded.

## Python Tooling Rules
- Repo-managed Python execution must not generate `__pycache__`, `.pyc`, or `.pyo` artifacts.
- Use repo-owned execution wrappers and environment guards for Python-based helpers.
- Keep pyssh tooling self-contained under `tools/pyssh` and bootstrappable from the repo.

## Testing and Quality Rules
- Maintain PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7 compatibility.
- Keep non-live quality checks runnable locally.
- Keep CI non-destructive and non-live; do not run real Azure provisioning in GitHub Actions.
- Maintain a local hook path and a GitHub Actions quality gate together.
- No commit may introduce concrete secrets, contact-style values, personal identifiers, organization identifiers, or live-target sample values into tracked code, docs, examples, tests, or commit messages.
- Maintain an always-on sensitive-content audit in local hooks and CI; update that audit in the same change whenever new committed surfaces or new leak-prone example formats are introduced.
- For live publish or release-readiness claims, require one successful end-to-end live acceptance cycle against the active profile: clean `create` when safe, full natural-order `update`, `show` redaction check, `do --vm-action=status`, connection tests, and enabled feature verification.
- Update audit/contract checks when command names, docs, env keys, or task-folder behavior change.

## Documentation Responsibilities
- `AGENTS.md`: engineering contract and collaboration rules.
- `README.md`: operator and contributor guide.
- `LICENSE`: repository licensing terms.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: contributor workflow, expectations, and review hygiene.
- `SUPPORT.md`: operator/support routing and escalation guidance.
- `SECURITY.md`: vulnerability-reporting policy and private disclosure path.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: participation expectations for repository spaces.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: full project history from first day to today.
- `release-notes.md`: current release-oriented summary.
- `roadmap.md`: forward-looking project plan.
- `docs/prompt-history.md`: human-readable prompt ledger with English-normalized user prompts and assistant summaries.
- When maintained repository documentation records a time-of-day, record it in UTC.

## Release Versioning Rule
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `release-notes.md` must use `YYYY.M.D.N`.
- `N` is the cumulative repository commit count at the documented release point.
- Keep changelog and release-notes version labels aligned for the current documented release.

## Prompt-History Rule
- Do not auto-record very short approval, confirmation, interruption, or follow-up prompts such as `yes`, `no`, `ok`, `continue`, `I stopped it halfway`, or similarly short action nudges.
- Do not auto-record non-mutating user prompts that only ask questions, request analysis, or request investigation without causing repo file changes.
- For those excluded prompt types, the assistant must answer normally and end with a short hint that the prompt can be recorded on request.
- Record every other completed user prompt in `docs/prompt-history.md`, including substantive repo-changing prompts and substantive operational prompts, together with the assistant's final summary.
- If the user replies yes or gives another clearly positive confirmation, append the most recent user-assistant dialog to `docs/prompt-history.md` and create the corresponding git commit as a special exception.
- Maintain full two-way dialog continuity for recorded turns.
- Do not omit completed substantive turns that changed repo files.
- Keep the file appendable, chronologically ordered, and human-readable.
- Record prompt-history entries in English.
- Record prompt-history timestamps as `### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC`.
- If the original user prompt or assistant summary is not English, translate it to English before recording it in `docs/prompt-history.md`.
- If the original user prompt or assistant summary is already English, record it unchanged.
- Use the relevant `.codex` JSONL files as the primary source when reconstructing past turns.

## Commit and Change Discipline
- Make small, contextual, developer-friendly English commits.
- Use prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
- Reflect the real scope of the change.
- Do not batch unrelated changes into one commit.
- Before creating the final commit for a repo-changing prompt, update `CHANGELOG.md` and `release-notes.md` in the same final change set whenever the prompt changed shipped behavior, docs, configuration contract, workflow, or engineering process.
- Treat that changelog/release-notes update as part of the same prompt deliverable, not as a new follow-up change that triggers another recursive documentation pass.
- Before presenting the final summary to the user, create the commit for the completed prompt.
- Use `tools/enable-git-hooks.ps1` and `tools/disable-git-hooks.ps1` for local hook management; do not reintroduce one-way hook installers.

## Required Assistant Workflow
- Explore before mutating.
- Prefer `rg` / `rg --files` for search.
- Use non-interactive git commands.
- Never use destructive git resets or checkouts unless explicitly requested.
- If unexpected third-party edits appear, stop and ask the user how to proceed.
- When a change affects docs, config contract, or command surface, update the corresponding contract files in the same prompt.
