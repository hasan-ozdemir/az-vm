# Windows Store Migration Audit

This audit captures the current `windows/update` application install surface and highlights which apps are already Store-backed, which ones have a plausible `winget + msstore` path that still needs explicit maintainer approval, and which ones should stay on their current installer source for now.

Status rules used here:
- `already-store-backed`: the current tracked task already installs from `msstore`.
- `candidate-awaiting-approval`: a credible `msstore` package was found, but the repo will not migrate the installer source until the maintainer explicitly approves the move.
- `keep-current-source`: the current source remains the recommended path for this repo at the moment.
- `not-a-store-app`: the app is not part of the Windows Store migration question for the current tracked task.

## Approval Gate

No installer-source migration was applied for these current Store candidates:
- `Microsoft Edge`
- `Docker Desktop`
- `Visual Studio Code`

If you approve any of them, the next change should update:
- the owning install task
- installer verification logic
- public desktop shortcut expectations when the app becomes Store-backed
- smoke tests and docs in the same patch
